How to start developing
1.  Install Node.js and npm.
2.  (Optional) Install and use Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
3.  Download source code from TFS.
4.  Run 'Initialize-Solution.ps1' (you will need Powershell 5 in order to successfully execute the script).
5.  Create account on https://www.zomato.com and generate your API key (https://developers.zomato.com/api).
6.  Create environment variable ZOMATO_USER_KEY and set its value to Zomato API key.
    -OR-
    Open ./src/server/server.ts, find string 'PUT YOUR USER KEY HERE' and replace it with the Zomato API key.
7.  (Optional) Run 'npm install -g gulp-cli' if you want to run gulp scripts from command prompt (use VS Code otherwise).

Tips:
* Press CTRL+SHIFT+B inside VS Code to build server and client side code.
* Press F5 inside VS Code to build code and start debug session.
* Environment is configured to generate source maps for both server and client side so you can debug TypeScript code directly from VS Code and browser.
